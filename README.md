# computing and stories


This is a repository for Computing and Stories Summit at SFPC. We will use this repository to collet workshop and presentation materials, code and illustrations and documents for the summit website. 

[Announcement](http://blog.sfpc.io/post/160345176196/computing-and-stories-summit)

In the first Computing and Stories Summit at the School for Poetic Computation, we’d like to invite the wider community to explore following questions through workshops and presentations:

How can we illustrate complex technical concepts through playful and inviting visuals? How can we contribute to a culture of engineering and science that’s respectful and inviting to women, people of color, disabled persons, and the LGBTQ community? How can we use storytelling as a vehicle to bring change to the unequal and unethical systems around technology? How can we create stories that reveal these complex questions through engaging narrative?
